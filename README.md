# Tailwind Exercise

This was an excuse to use [TailwindCSS][tw]. This was my first foray into a
functional CSS framework, have to say it was fun to build something from scratch
without ever writing a line of CSS.

Not sure if I'd ever use this for a large
project, but for simple little one page bangers or maybe even as big as a blog I
could see this working well.
